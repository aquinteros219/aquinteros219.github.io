<h2>Choose The Right Path</h2>

<h3>It is night time and you are alone in your house, watching TV in the living room. You suddenly hear a loud knock on your door...but you’re not expecting anyone. You stay silent for a couple of seconds, wondering who it can be. Then, there is another harder and louder knock. What is your response?</h2>

<button onclick="silent()">Stay silent</button>
<button onclick="ask()">Ask who's there</button>
<button onclick="door()">Open the door</button>

	<script>


function silent() {
		alert('You chose to stay silent. Whoever is knocking on your door is persistent because they’re not going away.');

}

function ask() {
		alert('You requested for the knocker’s identity. They just simply command you to open the door.');

}

function door() {
		alert('You opened the door to see a buff-looking cyborg wearing sunglasses. He tells you to come with him if you want to live. You chose the right path.');
