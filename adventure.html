<h1>Choose The Right Path</h1>

<h2>It is night time and you are alone in your house, watching TV in the living room. You suddenly hear a loud knock on your door...but you’re not expecting anyone. You stay silent for a couple of seconds, wondering who it can be. Then, there is another harder and louder knock. What is your response?</h2>

<button onclick="ask()">Ask who's there</button>
<button onclick="door()">Open the door</button>

function ask() {
